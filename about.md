Open source developer, FOSS enthusiast, & avid GNU Emacs user. [My public keys](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=psachin&op=index)

### More information

I try not to be biased with any programming language or technology.
GNU/Linux, Free and Open Source Software are the reasons I survived so
far.

#### My work-space

##### @Home

My current system is Lenovo G505s with AMD A8 Quad-core processor and
8 Gigs of RAM running Slackware 14.1(I always prefer
[latest kernel](https://github.com/psachin/bash_scripts/blob/master/build_my_kernel.sh)).
I usually work on this system.

My other system includes Acer _emachines_ eM350 netbook also running
Slackware. I also have an old desktop with AMD Athlon with 2 Gigs of
RAM running Slackware again!. The system's storage is shared via NFS
across my home network, basically this is my NFS server.

Apart from this I have a very old Intel Pentium II Machine with 350MHz
processor and 64MB of RAM running Vector linux. I wonder how this
machine [still
runs](https://plus.google.com/+Sachinp/posts/UMCp3L6NiAn?pid=5864821069617337218&oid=113870692888444102463)?

Most of my home network and Internet connection is managed by D-LINK
DIR-615E wireless router flashed with custom
OpenWRT(_barrier-breaker_). This is my backup(and tiny) Linux system
with minimal shell and `opkg` package manager.

### Tools I use

![img]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about/tools-server-300px.png){: .center-image}

Emacs and a terminal are the least I need.

I prefer to use latest Emacs version. My Emacs is heavily configured
for all my needs from programming(Python, Django, C, elisp, Ruby,
shell etc.), blog & note taking(org-mode), eshell, tramp, magit etc.
Recently I fell in love with `M-x emacs-timemachine`. Terminal is
occasionally needed to keep some front-end jobs running.

`Git` is something I can't live without. I use Git to keep track of my
personal notes, blogs, and all the projects. `magit` is a savior. It
helps me a lot to learn insights of Git.

I prefer `Gnus` over `mutt` to manage mails.

### More..

I find programming in `elisp` relaxing when I'm bored with Python and
friends. Though not much but I do write some helper functions in
elisp. These code snippets are managed and shared on
[haqiba.org](http://haqiba.org).
