Sticky bits explained


## sticky bits

- It actually use to set `setuid` & `setgid`
- `setuid` allows users to run an executable with the permissions of
  the file owner.
- `setgid` allows users in the group to run an executable with the
  permissions of the file owner's group.
- They are used to prevent other users from altering files/directory
  in a common workspace like `/var/share` or `/tmp`
- `-t` is used to protect files within a directory. This is also
  called *restricted deletion flag.

     *Usage*

        chmod +t /var/share

- In some case you want all user to execute particular binary but
  keeping file ownership to yourself. Suppose the file is
  `/usr/bin/bin2hex`

    In such situation *sticky bit* is handy

        chmod +s /usr/bin/bin2hex

    This will set both setuid & setgid, if you want to have fine
    control, use u+s, or g+s

    *Example*: setuid ONLY

        chmod u+s /usr/bin/bin2hex

    *Example*: setgid ONLY

        chmod g+s /usr/bin/bin2hex

    or you can remove sticky bits using `u-s`, `g-s`

-   Binary implementation of *Restrict file deletion flag*

        chmod +t /var/share
        # is equivalent to
        chmod 1755 /var/share

    We can also set both `setuid` and *Restrict file deletion flag*

        chmod 5755 /var/share
        # is equivalent to
        chmod u+s,+t /var/share

### Explanation

   Say the permission on file is **5755**

   Lets break it as **5** and **755**

   **5** = **4**(setuid or +s) + **1**(restrict file deletion flag or +t)

   **755** is `rwx-r-x-r-x`


### Another example

   **7755** can be broke into **7** & **755**

   **7** = **4**(setuid) + **2**(setgid) + **1**(restrict file deletion bit)

### Final note

   A classic example of sticky bit is the permission set on binary
   file `passwd`. Although it is owned by root, `setuid` is set for
   normal users to execute the program in-order to change password. It
   was invented by Dennis Ritchie around 1972.
