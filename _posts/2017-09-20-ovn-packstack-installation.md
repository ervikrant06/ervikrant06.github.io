In this article, I am going to show the packstack deployment using ovn as mechansim driver. Pike is the first release which introduced the support for ovn in packstack deployment tool. It require just few changes in answer.txt file to make the deployment successful with ovn as mechanism driver. 

Question arises what is OVN? OVN stands for Open Virtual Network. It's replacement for OVS (Openvswitch) mechanism driver, basically OVN is an extended form of OVS which will be taking care of L2 and L3 packet flows using openflows only which was not possible with OVS without network namespaces. Openflows supporting L3 traffic are present on all compute nodes which means that instances with floating IP will be having direct connectivity with external network from compute node itself instead of traversing through the controller nodes similar to DVR. But in case of DVR still the namespaces were coming into the picture which increases the number of hops in the network path. Also, in DVR if the instance is not having floating IP address then traffic has to go through controller nodes because NAT will happen on that node, in OVN new distributed gateway concept is introduced which makes this opertion also happen on one of the compute node instead of controller node. Note: Distributed GW is not running on all compute nodes, only few of them can have it. It's decided by scheduler on which compute node distributed gateway should be placed. 

Let's what changes we need to made in Openstack packstack answer.txt file to make the deployment using OVN as mechanism driver. 

Step 1 : I have done the deployment using one controller and two compute nodes. In the following example, I am just showing the ovn related changes in the answer.txt file for sake of brevity. 

~~~
[root@controller ~]# grep -i ovn /root/answer.txt | grep -v "#"
CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_MECHANISM_DRIVERS=ovn
CONFIG_NEUTRON_L2_AGENT=ovn
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=extnet:br-ex
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGE_IFACES=br-ex:ens3
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_BRIDGES_COMPUTE=br-ex
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_EXTERNAL_PHYSNET=extnet
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_TUNNEL_IF=
CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVN_TUNNEL_SUBNETS=
~~~

One more change is required to support the new tunnel type `geneve`. 

~~~
[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]# grep 'geneve' /root/answer.txt | grep -v "#"
CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS=vxlan,flat,geneve
CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TENANT_NETWORK_TYPES=vxlan,geneve
~~~

Step 2 : Let's check which version of OVN is installed after succesful packstack deployment. It's `ovs-ovn 2.7`

~~~
[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]# rpm -qa | grep -i ovn
openstack-nova-novncproxy-16.0.0-1.el7.noarch
openvswitch-ovn-common-2.7.2-3.1fc27.el7.x86_64
openvswitch-ovn-host-2.7.2-3.1fc27.el7.x86_64
novnc-0.5.1-2.el7.noarch
puppet-ovn-11.3.0-1.el7.noarch
openvswitch-ovn-central-2.7.2-3.1fc27.el7.x86_64
python-networking-ovn-3.0.0-1.el7.noarch
~~~

Verify that mechanism driver is set to ovn. 

~~~
[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]# grep ovn /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini
mechanism_drivers=ovn
[ovn]
ovn_nb_connection=tcp:192.168.122.39:6641
ovn_sb_connection=tcp:192.168.122.39:6642
~~~

Everything is commented in ovn `networking-ovn.ini` file by default.  

~~~
[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]# ll /etc/neutron/plugins/networking-ovn/networking-ovn.ini
-rw-r-----. 1 root neutron 3826 Aug 30 07:50 /etc/neutron/plugins/networking-ovn/networking-ovn.ini
[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]# egrep -v "^(#|$)" /etc/neutron/plugins/networking-ovn/networking-ovn.ini
[DEFAULT]
[ovn]
[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#
~~~

Step 3 : Create some test internal network, external network and router using the same neutron commands. Add internal network as port in router and set external network as gateway for router.

Two logical switches are connected corresponding to internal1 and external_network. router is created with first IP address from subnet range and this IP will be used for NAT of the instances which are not having floating IP associated with them.  

Check out what are the differences present when using ovn as mechanism driver instead of ovs (openvswitch). 

- First of all private networks are created with new tunnel type instead of vxlan.

- No network namespaces are present corresponding to created networks. That means you would not be able to connect to instances which are not having floating IP address from the network namespace. But this feature is again introduced in later versions.

In the next post, we will discuss about the architecture of OVN which will help us to understand why these things are missing from OVN.
