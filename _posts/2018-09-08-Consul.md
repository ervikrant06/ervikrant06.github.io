While working with kubernetes, I was intrigued by the service discovery topic. I read about consul in past but never got the chance to make my hands dirty with it. Today, I spend sometime to run the consul in docker environment. I used `docker-machine` on MAC with virtual box to quicly start a machine with docker.

#### Running with default options

~~~
$ docker-machine create consulserver
$ docker-machine ssh consulserver
docker@consulserver:~$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

- Start a consul container without providing any options. consul started in server mode. On eth0 port of docker container "172.17.0.2" ip address is assigned which is normal behavior. 

~~~
docker@consulserver:~$ docker run -d consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1
43f8be212338baafd0511deb0a4629061881a91343cc70fedb0cb72dd41aec61

$ docker exec -it 43f8be212338baafd0511deb0a4629061881a91343cc70fedb0cb72dd41aec61 ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
19: eth0@if20: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

- Check the logs of container. http, dns are listening on loopback address and LAN, WAN on docker eth0 ip. That means if we start another docker-machine and try to reach conul server we would not be able to reach it. In-fact conul GUI is also no accessible.

- Start a consul agent in client mode. Now we have two containers (consul in server and client mode) running on consulserver machine.

- Since no option was provided to let consul client know where conul server is present hence in the logs these messages are expected.

#### Make consul client detect consul server


- Delete the previous consul client container and start new container stating the ip address of consul server so that client can join the server. Hurray!! logs confirmed that consul client is connected with server.

#### Change bind interface of consul server

Tear down the previous containers. 

- It's stated in official consul image document that we should start the consul in host mode hence instead of default bridge networking this time host mode is used to start the container. As now host mode is used hence all interfaces available on docker-machine will be present inside the container. Since the multiple interfaces are present on host machine hence we need to mention bind interface.

- Logs showing that this time LAN and WAN gossip protocols listening on ipaddress assigned to eth1 interface. Still we will not be able to access the UI of consul because 8500 is listening on loopback address.

- This time instead of starting the consul in client mode on same machine I started another docker-machine and spawned container on that node in consul client mode. 

~~~
$ docker-machine create consulclient
$ docker-machie ssh consulclient

- I wanted to start consul client in host mode and made it listen on interface which is externally reachable hence I teared down the setup but I forgot to remove the client from consul membership. Used force-leave command remove it from the membership.

- One silly experiment - Start another consul client agent on the node on which our consul server is running, it will not run, any guesses?? because the ports are already used by consul server hence I started consul client in bridge networking mode.

#### Why the UI still not accessible

- Make 8500 listen on eth1 interface by adding another env variable `CONSUL_CLIENT_INTERFACE` and also add `-ui` flag.

- Now if you gonna check the membership of consul it will fail because the endpoint has changed from loopback to eth1 ip address. Specify the endpoing with eth1 ip address in command to list consul members.

#### Final commands to start consul

- Create json file with the configuration and empty data directory which will help to maintain the state of consul cluster after restarts.

~~~
docker@consulserver:~$ cat conf.json
{
"datacenter":"labsetup",
"enable_debug":true
}
~~~

- Start the consul agent in server and client mode in different nodes.
