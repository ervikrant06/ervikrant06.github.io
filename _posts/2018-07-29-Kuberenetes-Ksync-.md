Recently I was working on simple app which I wanted to deploy in K8, it was cumbersome task to write some code and then doing everything manually to ensure that it's working fine in K8 setup. I came across a wonderful tool ksync which helps to sync the changes which are doing locally directly in the K8 POD. This works in client/server architecture similar to helm. Once you dowmnload the kysnc initialize the ksync again similar to helm, it will start daemonset in the K8. 

All the instructions are available on github. 

- Download the ksync on your laptop.

↳	It appears that watch isn't running. You can start it with 'ksync watch'
~~~

- Start the watch so that code changes which you are doing on your laptop are reflected inside the container directly.

Please refer the example available on github. It works like a charm. I have never seen anything working so smoothly.
