Now a days I am spending good amount of time to understand the NSD and VNFD stuff. I work on Ciena Blueplanet MDSO product which is complaint with ETSI standards. In this article, I am going to share basic information about the VNFD and NSD.

Before diving into the basics of VNFD and NSD, I would like to provide information about the ETSI MANO. Goal of ETSI MANO is to do research into whats require to manage and orchestrate the VNFs.
