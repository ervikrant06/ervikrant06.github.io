`pdftk` can be an excellent tool for manupilating PDFs if you know
some handy commands

# merge pages

suppose I have some PDF pages like

    front.pdf, toc.pdf, auth_colo.pdf, part1.pdf, chap01.pdf,
    chap02.pdf, part2.pdf, chap03.pdf, chap04.pdf, chap05.pdf,
    part3.pdf, app_A.pdf, app_B.pdf, and, index.pdf


If I want to merge all the pdf's into a single book(file), my command
would be

    pdftk front.pdf toc.pdf auth_colo.pdf part1.pdf chap01.pdf...index.pdf cat output my_full_book.pdf

this will create a pdf file in the same order specified. *\*.pdf* may
also work if I don't care about page ordering. Remember that
`my_full_book.pdf` is output file name and `cat output` are output
flags.

# removing a page

suppose I want to remove page number 3 then my command would be

    pdftk my_full_book.pdf cat 1-2 4-end output full_book_with_page2-removed.pdf

in the above example, I skipped page number(s) which I want to
remove, in this case, page-3. The above command means, I want
pages to be included from 1 to 2, I don't want page number 3, so
**skip it**, then start from page 4 till the **end**.

the syntax goes like this

    pdftk PDF_FILE cat FROM-TO FROM-end output NEW_PDF_FILE_NAME

# rotating pages

If I want to rotate the first page at 90 degrees right, then

    pdftk my_full_book.pdf cat 1R 2-end output page1_turned_right.pdf

in the same way if I want to rotate all odd pages from range 1 to
25 to 180 degrees, then

    pdftk my_full_book.pdf cat 1-25oddD 26-end output odd_pages_down_book.pdf

# Extract specific page(s)

    pdftk lkn.pdf cat 4 5 output page4and5.pdf

    pdftk lkn.pdf cat 9 output page9.pdf

Split pages as individual file

    pdftk page4and5.pdf burst

Output file will be `pg_0001.pdf`, `pg_0002.pdf`...
