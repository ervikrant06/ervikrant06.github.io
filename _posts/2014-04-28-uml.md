UML is a port of linux to linux as referred by Jeff Dike, the man
behind UML. It is a virtual machine which runs on linux and used to
debug new kernel builds and kernel modules. In this post, I will show
how to compile, and run UML

# Compile

Download latest kernel source from
[kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/), as of this writing, the kernel
version was 3.14.2

    wget -c https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.14.2.tar.xz

Un-compress and visit the directory

    tar -xvJf linux-3.14.2.tar.xz
    cd linux-3.14.2

Clean previous configs, blobs using

    make mrproper; make mrproper ARCH=um; make clean

Load default host config

    make defconfig ARCH=um

If you don't start with a defconfig, then the kernel build will be
that of the host(it will find a config file in /boot), which is not
appropriate for UML and will produce a UML that lacks vital drivers
and won't boot.

    make menuconfig ARCH=um

Select host processor type and features

Save and exit menuconfig window.

Finally, compile the kernel

    make linux ARCH=um

The result will be 2 binaries, `vmlinuz` & `linux`

# Run

Boot your newly compiled kernel using

    ./linux

This should die with a message something like

    Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(98,0)

- Boot with rootfs
  - Now that the kernel was unable to find roofs, you can download
  rootfs from <http://fs.devloop.org.uk/>

  - Add a parameter `ubda` followed by your rootfs
  path. Optionally, you may also add a `mem` parameter to specify
  amount of RAM your UML should use.

            ./linux ubda=/path/to/rootFS mem=128M
