Latest preview build for SailfishOS - Fiskarsinjoki(2.0.4.14) is
released and available for download. SailfishOS
uses [Mer](http://merproject.org/) middleware,
has [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org) and developed
by [jolla](https://jolla.com/). The latest release is not yet
available on air but can be upgraded using developer mode.

### Enable remote SSH

With SailfishOS, debugging a phone is quite simple, one just needs to
enable **Developer mode** & **Remote connection** from *Developer
tools*. Provide the password for user *nemo*(Yes, the default user is
'nemo') or generate password if you choose not to enter password of
your choice.(I never managed to ssh to IP-address 192.168.2.15 even by
setting similar network space)

```

Login as root using the command `devel-su`

``` bash
[nemo@Sailfish ~]$ devel-su
Password:
[root@Sailfish nemo]#
```

### Update

Verify the current release by using the command `version`. Check the
latest release on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS).
Say you want to update to latest release(2.0.4.14, at the time when
this post was published), set the release version using command `ssu
release VERSION`

``` bash
ssu release 2.0.4.14
version --dup
```

This should take a while.

### Remove default package

To remove preinstall package like *gaana*, search by name using the
command `pkcon`(PackageKit Console client).

``` bash
[root@Sailfish ~]# pkcon search name gaana

Starting
Refreshing software list
Querying
Installed sailfish-content-partnerspaces-intex-gaana-0.1.5-10.8.1.jolla.armv7hl	Gaana partner space application for Intex
```

Once the exact name of the package is found, go ahead and remove the
package using `pkcon remove PACKAGE_NAME`. Exclude version number.
`pkcon` should behave like any other package manager found in various
GNU/Linux distros.

``` bash
[root@Sailfish ~]# pkcon remove sailfish-content-partnerspaces-intex-gaana

### Verify & install package

Sometime you may want to check the integrity of an OS. In this case
the command `version --verify` will come handy as demonstrated below.

I found SailfishOS much more comfortable to use. The best part is it
has very good user interface as compared to other mobile UI like
Android. Once you have an Jolla account, the device has access to all
package repositories. It has early access to latest version and
upgrade is quite simple. The device comes pre-rooted with entire
GNU/Linux OS and package-manager(`pkcon`). One can install all Android
apps either from Jolla store or using Google Play store.
